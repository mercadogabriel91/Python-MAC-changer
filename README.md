# python-mac-changer
This is a very simple and basic MAC address changer i built using python. (this is my first program built using py)

How to use?
Add execution permission (chmod +x) if you're using Linux and then simply ./mac_changer.py

you can use the flag -h or --help to display the help options.

Both -i (interface) and -m (new mac address) are required so you will need to run: ./mac_changer.py -i **interfaceName** -m **newMacAddress**
